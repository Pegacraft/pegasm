# The worst programing language made
Seriously, this is just  fun project for myself, so i have something to do, and learn a few things. 
Its not meant to be competitve or anything. But if you want to run it, pull the repo and run the main file followed by the file that contains the code.

(Documentation will follow if im not too lazy)
